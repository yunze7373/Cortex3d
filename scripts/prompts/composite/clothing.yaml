  Using the provided images, place the clothing/garment from Image 2 onto the person in Image 1.

  Ensure that the following features of the person in Image 1 remain COMPLETELY UNCHANGED:
  - Face: all facial features, expression, gaze direction, makeup
  - Hair: exact style, length, color, texture
  - Skin tone and any visible marks
  - Body proportions and build
  - Pose: exact body position, hand placement, leg stance, head angle
  - Background: environment, lighting, shadows

  The new clothing should:
  - Fit naturally on the person's body shape and pose
  - Have realistic fabric draping, folds, and wrinkles matching the pose
  - Reflect the same lighting conditions as Image 1
  - Create consistent shadows
