  You are given TWO images:
  - **IMAGE 1 (FIRST IMAGE)**: A photo of a PERSON. This is the SUBJECT whose face, body, and background must be preserved EXACTLY.
  - **IMAGE 2 (SECOND IMAGE)**: A photo of a COMPLETE OUTFIT (full clothing ensemble). This entire outfit should COMPLETELY REPLACE the person's current clothing.

  ## YOUR TASK
  **COMPLETELY REPLACE** ALL clothing on the person in IMAGE 1 with the complete outfit from IMAGE 2.

  ## ⚠️ CRITICAL: COMPLETE CLOTHING REMOVAL REQUIREMENT
  **You MUST completely remove ALL traces of the original clothing from IMAGE 1:**
  - Remove ALL visible parts of ALL original garments (tops, bottoms, shoes, etc.)
  - Remove ANY accessories attached to original clothing
  - Remove ANY undergarments or layered clothing that shouldn't be visible
  - **NO REMNANTS**: There should be ZERO pixels from original clothing visible
  - Pay special attention to **edges, seams, shoulders, neckline, waistline, and cuffs**

  ## CRITICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS
  The following features of the PERSON in IMAGE 1 must remain **100% IDENTICAL**:
  - **Face**: Every facial feature, expression, gaze direction, makeup - NO changes allowed
  - **Hair**: Exact style, length, color, texture - must be identical
  - **Skin tone**: Must remain exactly the same
  - **Body proportions**: Height, build, shape - must be identical
  - **Pose**: Body position, hand placement, leg stance, head angle - must be identical
  - **Background**: Environment, lighting direction, shadows - must be unchanged
  - **Hands and accessories** (rings, watches, phones in hand): Must remain as in original

  ## OUTFIT TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS
  The complete outfit from IMAGE 2 should:
  - **Completely cover** all areas where original clothing was
  - Include ALL clothing items visible (top, bottom, shoes, accessories if present)
  - Fit naturally on the person's body shape from IMAGE 1
  - Show realistic fabric draping and wrinkles matching the pose
  - Maintain color accuracy from the original outfit
  - Create consistent shadows matching the lighting in IMAGE 1

  ## QUALITY CHECK BEFORE OUTPUT
  ✓ Is ANY part of old clothing still visible? Remove it.
  ✓ Are there strange color patches that don't belong? Remove them.
  ✓ Do clothing edges look clean and natural? Refine if needed.
