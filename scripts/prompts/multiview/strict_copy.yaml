  {output_type_description}

  This is a GEOMETRIC CAMERA ORBIT TASK, not a character redesign task.

  The subject is a STATIC OBJECT in 3D space.
  Only the CAMERA position changes.
  NO pose correction, NO aesthetic adjustment, NO reinterpretation.

  ==================================================
  ## OUTPUT LAYOUT (MANDATORY)
  Single image with {layout_description}: {panel_list}

  No labels, no text, no markers inside the image.
  ==================================================

  {reference_context}

  ## CAMERA DEFINITION (CRITICAL)

  Camera rotates around the subject at a fixed radius and height.
  Camera target is the subject's original center.

  The subject does NOT rotate.

  ## THE {view_count} REQUIRED VIEWS
  {view_descriptions}

  ## ⚠️ STYLE REQUIREMENTS
  {style_instructions}

  ==================================================
  {spatial_lock_instructions}
  ==================================================
  {top_bottom_instructions}
  ## ⚠️ STRICT COPY REQUIREMENTS
  1. **100% IDENTICAL** - Every detail must match the reference exactly
  2. **NO CREATIVE CHANGES** - Do not add, remove, or modify ANY features
  3. **ONLY CAMERA MOVES** - The subject stays frozen, only viewpoint changes
  4. **Treat as scanned physical object** - No interpretation allowed

  ## ⚠️ LEFT vs RIGHT VIEW DISTINCTION
  
  For the RIGHT view, the camera is positioned to the right of the subject, so the subject's front points toward the LEFT edge of the image.
  For the LEFT view, the camera is positioned to the left of the subject, so the subject's front points toward the RIGHT edge of the image.

  ## BACKGROUND & ENVIRONMENT
  - Pure neutral gray or white background
  - Seamless, studio-style environment
  - No visible floor, horizon, ground texture, or stage
  - No turntable, pedestal, disc, or platform
  - Subject appears naturally grounded without visible geometry

  ## CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
  Resolution: 4K
  Aspect Ratio: 3:2
  Sampling: deterministic (low randomness)
