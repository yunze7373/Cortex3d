  Create a {view_count}-panel CHARACTER REFERENCE SHEET showing THIS EXACT PERSON/OBJECT from the reference image.

  ## OUTPUT LAYOUT
  Single image with {layout_description}: {panel_list}

  {reference_context}

  ## THE {view_count} REQUIRED VIEWS
  {view_descriptions}

  ## ⚠️ CRITICAL: STYLE CONSISTENCY
  {style_instructions}

  ## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ MOST CRITICAL: POSE MUST BE 100% IDENTICAL IN ALL VIEWS ⚠️⚠️⚠️
  
  **THE SUBJECT IS FROZEN LIKE A STATUE. THE CAMERA MOVES, NOT THE SUBJECT.**
  
  Imagine the person/object is:
  - Completely FROZEN in the EXACT pose from the reference image
  - Like a statue or mannequin - absolutely no movement allowed
  - The camera orbits around this frozen subject
  
  **EVERY SINGLE VIEW must show:**
  - SAME arm positions (if arms are down, they stay down in ALL views)
  - SAME leg positions (if standing straight, stay standing straight in ALL views)
  - SAME head angle (if looking forward, head stays looking forward in ALL views)
  - SAME body posture (if standing upright, stay upright even in TOP/BOTTOM views)
  - SAME hand positions, finger positions, everything
  
  **FOR TOP VIEW (looking down from above):**
  - Camera is above looking DOWN at the frozen subject
  - Subject does NOT bend over or look down
  - Subject maintains the SAME upright standing pose
  - We see the top of the head, shoulders from above
  
  **FOR BOTTOM VIEW (looking up from below):**
  - Camera is below looking UP at the frozen subject
  - Subject does NOT lie down or change pose
  - Subject maintains the SAME upright standing pose
  - We see the underside of chin, feet from below

  ## ⚠️ STRICT COPY REQUIREMENTS
  1. **100% IDENTICAL** - Every detail must match the reference exactly
  2. **NO CREATIVE CHANGES** - Do not add, remove, or modify ANY features
  3. **EXACT APPEARANCE** - Same face, hair, clothes, accessories, proportions
  4. **ONLY CAMERA MOVES** - The subject stays frozen, only viewpoint changes
  5. **PRESERVE POSE** - Keep the exact same pose/stance in all views

  ## ⚠️ LEFT vs RIGHT VIEW DISTINCTION
  
  Think of the camera orbiting around the frozen subject:
  
  | View  | Camera Position | Object's Front Points To |
  |-------|-----------------|-------------------------|
  | RIGHT | Right of object | LEFT edge of image      |
  | LEFT  | Left of object  | RIGHT edge of image     |
  
  ⚠️ These are views from OPPOSITE sides - NOT mirrors!

  ## FORBIDDEN
  ❌ Any creative interpretation or style change
  ❌ Adding or removing clothing/accessories
  ❌ Changing facial features, hair, or body proportions
  ❌ **Different poses between panels** - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE
  ❌ Subject bending, crouching, or adjusting for camera angle
  ❌ Subject looking toward camera in each view
  ❌ Text labels on the image
  ❌ Turntable, platform, or any surface under the subject

  ## BACKGROUND
  - Solid neutral gray or white background
  - ❌ NO turntable, platform, pedestal, or floor
  - ✅ Subject appears to float naturally

  ## OUTPUT
  {layout_description} with {view_count} panels
  Same scale in all panels. Full body visible.

  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Generate EXACTLY {view_count} view(s) as specified. No more, no less.
  
  Generate {view_count} DISTINCT views of THIS EXACT PERSON/OBJECT - 100% faithful to reference, FROZEN POSE.
