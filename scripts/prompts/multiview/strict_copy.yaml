  Create a 4-panel CHARACTER TURNTABLE showing THIS PERSON from the reference image.

  ## TASK: TURNTABLE ROTATION (90° between each view)
  Imagine THIS PERSON is standing on a rotating platform. The platform rotates exactly 90° between each panel.

  ## THE 4 DISTINCT VIEWS (MUST BE DIFFERENT)
  Each panel shows THIS PERSON from a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT angle:

  | Panel | Angle | What You See | Key Identifier |
  |-------|-------|--------------|----------------|
  | 1 | 0° (FRONT) | Face visible, looking at camera | BOTH EYES visible |
  | 2 | 90° (RIGHT SIDE) | Profile view, facing right | RIGHT EAR visible, NO face |
  | 3 | 180° (BACK) | Back of head, no face | BACK OF HEAD only |
  | 4 | 270° (LEFT SIDE) | Profile view, facing left | LEFT EAR visible, NO face |

  ## STRICT REQUIREMENTS
  1. ⚠️ EACH VIEW MUST BE UNIQUE - no duplicate angles
  2. ⚠️ Panel 1 and 3 must be OPPOSITE (face vs back of head)
  3. ⚠️ Panel 2 and 4 must be OPPOSITE (right ear vs left ear)
  4. Keep THIS PERSON's face, hair, clothes, and accessories identical across all views
  5. Only the CAMERA POSITION changes, character stays the same

  ## FORBIDDEN
  ❌ Two panels showing the face (front) 
  ❌ Two panels showing the back
  ❌ Two panels showing the same side profile
  ❌ Similar angles in adjacent panels
  ❌ Text labels on the image

  ## OUTPUT
  Single horizontal image: [FRONT 0°] [RIGHT 90°] [BACK 180°] [LEFT 270°]
  Gray background. Full body visible in all panels.

  Generate 4 DISTINCT turntable views of THIS PERSON.
