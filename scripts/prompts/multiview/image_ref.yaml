  Generate a 3D character turntable reference sheet with exactly 4 panels, showing the character described below from 4 angles.

  ## OUTPUT
  Single image with 4 panels horizontally: [FRONT] [RIGHT] [BACK] [LEFT]

  ## CHARACTER DESCRIPTION (from reference photo)
  {character_description}

  ## CRITICAL: PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL POSE
  ⚠️ The character has a SPECIFIC pose from the reference photo. You MUST preserve this pose:
  - If the character is WALKING → show walking pose from all 4 angles
  - If the character is SITTING → show sitting pose from all 4 angles  
  - If one leg is forward → keep that leg forward in all views
  - If arms are in a specific position → maintain that position

  DO NOT change the pose to a generic standing pose!

  ## TURNTABLE ROTATION
  The 4 panels show the SAME character in the SAME pose, just rotated:
  - Panel 1 (FRONT): 0° - facing camera
  - Panel 2 (RIGHT): 90° - right side visible
  - Panel 3 (BACK): 180° - back visible
  - Panel 4 (LEFT): 270° - left side visible

  ## ANATOMICAL RULES
  - Arms connect to shoulders only
  - Legs connect to hips only
  - Upper and lower body face the SAME direction
  - NO twisted bodies, NO extra limbs

  ## PANEL LAYOUT
  - 4 equal panels side by side
  - Same scale in all panels
  - Neutral gray background
  - NO text labels

  ## LIGHTING
  - Flat, even studio lighting
  - No harsh shadows
  - Face clearly visible

  Generate the character maintaining the EXACT pose described, viewed from 4 angles.
