  Generate a professional 3D reference sheet with exactly 4 panels arranged horizontally.

  ## OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
  Single image containing 4 panels in a row: [FRONT] [RIGHT] [BACK] [LEFT]

  ## OBJECT/CHARACTER
  {character_description}
  Style: {style}

  ## CAMERA POSITIONS (4 angles orbiting the object)
  
  Imagine the object in the center. The camera orbits around it clockwise:
  
  - Panel 1 (FRONT, 0°): Camera in front of the object
    → We see the FRONT surface of the object
    
  - Panel 2 (RIGHT, 90°): Camera on the RIGHT side of the object
    → We see the RIGHT surface of the object
    → The object's FRONT points toward the LEFT edge of the image
    
  - Panel 3 (BACK, 180°): Camera behind the object
    → We see the BACK surface of the object
    
  - Panel 4 (LEFT, 270°): Camera on the LEFT side of the object
    → We see the LEFT surface of the object
    → The object's FRONT points toward the RIGHT edge of the image

  ## ⚠️ CRITICAL: LEFT vs RIGHT - DO NOT CONFUSE!
  
  The key difference between Panel 2 (RIGHT) and Panel 4 (LEFT):
  
  | View  | Camera Position | Object's Front Points To |
  |-------|-----------------|-------------------------|
  | RIGHT | Right of object | LEFT edge of image      |
  | LEFT  | Left of object  | RIGHT edge of image     |
  
  ⚠️ These are OPPOSITE views from opposite sides - NOT mirrors!
  ⚠️ If panels 2 and 4 look similar, you made an error!

  ## CONSISTENCY RULES
  - SAME object in ALL 4 panels - only the camera angle changes
  - SAME pose/orientation/details in all panels
  - SAME scale and centering in all panels

  ## BACKGROUND
  - Solid neutral gray or white background
  - ❌ NO turntable, platform, or any surface under the object
  - ✅ Object appears to float naturally

  ## ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
  - NO text labels
  - NO mirror flips (panels 2 and 4 must show DIFFERENT sides)
  - NO turntable or platform

  Generate a clean, professional reference sheet following ALL rules above.

variables:
  - character_description
