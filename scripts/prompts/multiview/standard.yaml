  Generate a professional 3D character turntable reference sheet with exactly 4 panels arranged horizontally.

  ## OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
  Single image containing 4 panels in a row: [FRONT] [RIGHT] [BACK] [LEFT]

  ## CHARACTER
  {character_description}
  Style: {style}

  ## CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY

  ### TURNTABLE ROTATION (NOT MIRROR!)
  Imagine the character standing on a rotating platform:
  - Panel 1 (FRONT): Platform at 0° - We see the FACE, chest, front of body
  - Panel 2 (RIGHT SIDE): Platform rotated 90° clockwise - We see the RIGHT ear, RIGHT shoulder, RIGHT hip
  - Panel 3 (BACK): Platform rotated 180° - We see back of HEAD, spine, buttocks
  - Panel 4 (LEFT SIDE): Platform rotated 270° clockwise - We see the LEFT ear, LEFT shoulder, LEFT hip

  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Panels 2 and 4 are NOT mirrors! They show OPPOSITE sides of the body!
  - RIGHT SIDE shows: right ear, right arm, right leg
  - LEFT SIDE shows: left ear, left arm, left leg

  ### ANATOMICAL CORRECTNESS (CRITICAL!)
  - Arms MUST connect to shoulders only
  - Legs MUST connect to hips only
  - Head MUST connect to neck only
  - NO extra limbs, NO twisted body parts
  - Upper body and lower body MUST face the SAME direction in each panel
  - The entire body rotates together as one unit

  ### POSE CONSISTENCY (CRITICAL!)
  - EXACT same pose in ALL 4 panels - only the viewing angle changes
  - Same arm positions, same leg positions, same head tilt
  - If holding an object in right hand → it stays in right hand in ALL views
  - This is ONE character photographed from 4 angles, NOT 4 different poses

  ### PANEL LAYOUT
  - 4 equal-width panels arranged horizontally (side by side)
  - Character centered in each panel
  - Same scale/size in all panels
  - Clean separation between panels
  - Neutral gray or white background

  ### LIGHTING
  - Flat, even studio lighting (no harsh shadows)
  - Face clearly visible without shadow obstruction
  - Consistent lighting direction across all panels

  ### ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
  - NO text labels (no "front", "back", "left", "right")
  - NO twisted bodies (upper body facing different direction than legs)
  - NO mirror flips (left and right views must show different sides)
  - NO anatomical errors (no extra limbs, no wrong joint positions)
  - NO pose variations between panels

  Generate a clean, professional character reference sheet following ALL rules above.
