  Generate a professional 3D character turntable reference sheet with exactly {view_count} panels arranged in {layout_description}.

  ## OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
  Single image containing {view_count} panels: {panel_list}

  ## CHARACTER
  {character_description}
  Style: {style}

  ## CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY

  ### TURNTABLE ROTATION (NOT MIRROR!)
  Imagine the character standing on a rotating platform:
  {view_descriptions}

  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Each panel shows a UNIQUE angle. No duplicates!

  ### ANATOMICAL CORRECTNESS (CRITICAL!)
  - Arms MUST connect to shoulders only
  - Legs MUST connect to hips only
  - Head MUST connect to neck only
  - NO extra limbs, NO twisted body parts
  - Upper body and lower body MUST face the SAME direction in each panel
  - The entire body rotates together as one unit

  ### POSE CONSISTENCY (CRITICAL!)
  - EXACT same pose in ALL {view_count} panels - only the viewing angle changes
  - Same arm positions, same leg positions, same head tilt
  - If holding an object → it stays in the same hand in ALL views
  - This is ONE character photographed from {view_count} angles, NOT {view_count} different poses

  ### PANEL LAYOUT
  - {view_count} panels arranged as {layout_description}
  - Character centered in each panel
  - Same scale/size in all panels
  - Clean separation between panels
  - Neutral gray or white background

  ### LIGHTING
  - Flat, even studio lighting (no harsh shadows)
  - Face clearly visible without shadow obstruction
  - Consistent lighting direction across all panels

  ### ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
  - NO text labels (no "front", "back", "left", "right", no angle numbers)
  - NO twisted bodies (upper body facing different direction than legs)
  - NO mirror flips between side views
  - NO anatomical errors (no extra limbs, no wrong joint positions)
  - NO pose variations between panels

  Generate a clean, professional character reference sheet following ALL rules above.

  - character_description
