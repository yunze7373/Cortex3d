  Generate a professional 3D reference sheet with exactly {view_count} panels arranged in {layout_description}.

  ## OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
  Single image containing {view_count} panels: {panel_list}

  ## OBJECT/CHARACTER
  {character_description}
  Style: {style}

  ## CAMERA POSITIONS (orbiting around the object)
  
  The object stays stationary in the center. The CAMERA orbits around it:
  {view_descriptions}

  ⚠️ Each panel shows a UNIQUE camera angle. No duplicates!
  ⚠️ REFERENCE OVERRIDE: If provided a reference image, ROTATE the object to show the requested angles, do not just copy the reference angle.

  ## ⚠️ CRITICAL: LEFT vs RIGHT DISTINCTION
  
  Think of the camera orbiting around the object:
  
  | View  | Camera Position | Object's Front Points To |
  |-------|-----------------|-------------------------|
  | RIGHT | Right of object | LEFT edge of image      |
  | LEFT  | Left of object  | RIGHT edge of image     |
  
  ⚠️ These are views from OPPOSITE sides - NOT mirrors!
  ⚠️ If RIGHT and LEFT panels look similar, you made an error!

  ## CONSISTENCY RULES
  - SAME object in ALL {view_count} panels
  - SAME pose/orientation/details in all panels
  - Only the CAMERA ANGLE changes

  ## BACKGROUND
  - Solid neutral gray or white background
  - ❌ NO turntable, platform, or any surface under the object
  - ✅ Object appears to float naturally

  ## PANEL LAYOUT
  - {view_count} panels arranged as {layout_description}
  - Object centered in each panel, same scale
  - Clean separation between panels

  ## ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
  - NO text labels
  - NO mirror flips between opposite side views
  - NO turntable, platform, or pedestal

  Generate a clean, professional reference sheet following ALL rules above.

variables:
  - character_description
  - style
  - view_count
  - layout_description
  - panel_list
  - view_descriptions

default_style: "cinematic character"
